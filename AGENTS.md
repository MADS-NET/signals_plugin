# siggen — working notes for AI coding agents

This is a **MADS source plugin** written in C++17.

Framework context — the plugin lifecycle, the order in which the host agent
calls each method, what every return value does, how settings reach the plugin,
topics, blobs, testing, deployment and protocol migration — is in the
`mads-plugin` skill under [`.claude/skills/mads-plugin/`](.claude/skills/mads-plugin/SKILL.md).
**Read `SKILL.md` before changing plugin code**, and follow its `reference/`
files rather than inferring host behaviour from the template comments.

Regenerate that skill for a newer MADS with `mads plugin --update`.

## This plugin

<Describe what this plugin does: what it reads, what it publishes, and why.>

- Behavior: **source** — host agent `mads source`
- Class: `SiggenPlugin` in [`src/siggen.cpp`](src/siggen.cpp)
- Driver name: `siggen` — must stay equal to the CMake target name, so that `kind()` and the file stem agree
- INI section: `[siggen]` (or whatever `-n` selects at run time)

## Parameters

<List every INI key the plugin reads, its type, default and unit. Keep this
table and the README in sync — it is the plugin's public interface.>

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## Output frames

<Describe the JSON the plugin publishes (or consumes, for a sink): the fields,
their units, and the topic they go to.>

## Conventions for this project

- C++17, built with CMake; LLVM formatting, two-space indent.
- `CamelCase` for classes and namespaces, `snake_case` for methods and
  variables, `_leading_underscore` for private members, declared last.
- Do not add third-party dependencies without asking. `nlohmann/json` is
  already available, and the plugin base classes also provide a `SerialPort`
  helper in `serialport.hpp`.
- All plugin logic must be reachable from the test `main()` at the bottom of
  the source file, and that test must be deterministic and self-checking:
  assert on both the returned status and the payload, and exit non-zero on
  failure.
- An exception must never escape a plugin method: catch it, set `_error` and
  return `return_type::error`.
- Never block, sleep or busy-wait inside a plugin method.

## Build and test

```sh
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$(mads -p)"
cmake --build build -j4
./build/siggen                       # the standalone test driver
mads inspect_plugin build/siggen.plugin
mads source build/siggen.plugin
```
